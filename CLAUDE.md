# Claude Instructions for agent-team-mail

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Branch Management Rules

**NEVER switch the main repository branch on disk from `develop`.**

- Main repo at `/Users/randlee/Documents/github/agent-team-mail/` MUST remain on `develop` at all times
- **ALWAYS use `sc-git-worktree` skill** to create worktrees for all development work
- **ALWAYS create worktrees FROM `develop` branch** (not from `main`)
- Do NOT use `git checkout` or `git switch` in the main repository
- All sprint work happens in worktrees at `../agent-team-mail-worktrees/<branch-name>`
- **All PRs target `develop` branch** (integration branch, not `main`)

**Why**: Switching branches in the main repo breaks worktree references and destabilizes the development environment.

**Worktree Creation Pattern**:
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT: Create worktree from develop
/sc-git-worktree --create feature/1-2a-work-bead develop

# ❌ WRONG: Creating from main
/sc-git-worktree --create feature/1-2a-work-bead main
```

## Project Overview

**agent-team-mail** (`atm`) is a Rust CLI and daemon for mail-like messaging with Claude agent teams:
- Thin CLI over `~/.claude/teams/` file-based API (send, read, broadcast, inbox)
- Three-crate workspace: `atm-core` (library), `atm` (CLI), `atm-daemon` (plugin host)
- Atomic file I/O with conflict detection and guaranteed delivery
- Trait-based plugin system in daemon for extensibility (Issues, CI Monitor, Bridge, Chat, Beads, MCP)
- Provider-agnostic (GitHub, Azure DevOps, GitLab, Bitbucket)

**Goal**: Build a well-tested Rust CLI for agent team messaging, with a plugin-ready daemon.

---

## Project Plan

**Current Plan**: [`docs/project-plan.md`](./docs/project-plan.md)

- 5 phases, 18 sprints (Phase 6 open-ended for additional plugins)
- Parallel sprint tracks identified per phase
- Agent team execution: Scrum Master → Dev(s) + QA(s), Opus Architect on escalation
- All work on dedicated worktrees via `sc-git-worktree`

**Current Status**: Pre-development — requirements and plan under review

## Workflow

### Sprint Execution Pattern (Dev-QA Loop)

Every sprint follows this pattern:

1. **Create worktree** using `sc-git-worktree` skill
2. **Dev work** by assigned dev agent(s)
3. **QA validation** by assigned QA agent(s)
4. **Retry loop** if QA fails (max attempts configurable)
5. **Commit/Push/PR** to phase integration branch
6. **Agent-teams review** documenting what worked/didn't

### Phase Integration Branch Strategy

Each phase gets a dedicated integration branch off `develop`:

```
main
  └── develop
        └── integrate/phase-N              ← created at phase start
              ├── feature/pN-s1-...        ← PR targets integrate/phase-N
              ├── feature/pN-s2-...        ← PR targets integrate/phase-N
              └── feature/pN-s3-...        ← PR targets integrate/phase-N

        After all sprints merge → one PR: integrate/phase-N → develop
```

**Rules:**
- Sprint PRs target `integrate/phase-N` (not `develop` directly)
- After each sprint merges to the integration branch, subsequent sprints merge latest `integrate/phase-N` into their feature branch before creating their PR
- When all phase sprints are complete, one final PR merges `integrate/phase-N → develop`
- Phase integration branch is then cleaned up

### Worktree Cleanup Policy

**Do NOT clean up worktrees until the user has reviewed them.** The user reviews each sprint's worktree separately to check for design divergence before approving cleanup. Worktree cleanup is only performed when explicitly requested.

### Branch Flow

- Sprint PRs → `integrate/phase-N` (phase integration branch)
- Phase completion PR → `develop` (integration branch)
- Release PR → `main` (after user review/approval)
- Post-merge CI runs as safety net at each level

---

## Agent Model Selection

- **Haiku** - Exploration, test execution, simple validation
- **Sonnet** - Implementation work, documentation writing
- **Opus** - Critical planning, architecture decisions, complex review

---

## Environment

**Task List**: `agent-team-mail` (configured in `.env`)
**Agent Teams**: Enabled (experimental feature)

---

## Agent Team Mail (ATM) Communication

### Team Configuration

- **Team**: `atm-dev` (persistent across sessions)
- **ARCH-ATM** (you) is `team-lead` — start and maintain the `atm-dev` team for the session duration
- **ARCH-CTM** is a Codex agent — communicates **exclusively** via ATM CLI messages (not Claude Code team API)
- **All other Claude agents** communicate using Claude Code's built-in team messaging API (`SendMessage` tool)

### Identity

`.atm.toml` at repo root sets `identity = "team-lead"` and `default_team = "atm-dev"`, so all ATM CLI commands automatically use the correct identity and team. No need to prefix with `ATM_IDENTITY=` or `--team`.

**Note**: ARCH-CTM gets his identity from `ATM_IDENTITY=arch-ctm` set in his tmux session via `launch-worker.sh`.

### Communicating with ARCH-CTM (Codex)

ARCH-CTM does **not** monitor Claude Code messages. Use ATM CLI only:

**Send a message:**
```bash
atm send arch-ctm "your message here"
```

**Check your inbox for replies:**
```bash
atm read
```

**Check team inbox summary (who has unread messages):**
```bash
atm inbox
```

**Nudge ARCH-CTM to check inbox** (when he hasn't replied):

ARCH-CTM runs in a tmux pane. Discover the pane, then send-keys:
```bash
# Find arch-ctm's pane
tmux list-panes -a -F '#{session_name}:#{window_index}.#{pane_index} #{pane_title} #{pane_current_command}'

# Send nudge (use the correct pane ID from above)
tmux send-keys -t <pane-id> -l "You have unread ATM messages. Run: atm read --team atm-dev" && sleep 0.5 && tmux send-keys -t <pane-id> Enter
```

### Communication Rules

1. **No broadcast messages** — all communications are direct (team-lead ↔ specific agent)
2. **Poll for replies** — after sending to arch-ctm, wait 30-60s then `atm read`. If no reply after 2 minutes, nudge via tmux send-keys
3. **arch-ctm is async** — he processes messages on his next turn. Do not block waiting; continue other work and check back

### ATM CLI Quick Reference

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Send message | `atm send <agent> "msg"` |
| Read inbox | `atm read` |
| Inbox summary | `atm inbox` |
| List teams | `atm teams` |
| Team members | `atm members` |

---

## Initialization Process
1. Run: `atm teams resume <team>` where `<team>` is the `default_team` value from `.atm.toml` (e.g. `atm teams resume $(grep default_team .atm.toml | cut -d'"' -f2)`).
   Follow the output to call TeamCreate if needed.
2. Run: `atm teams cleanup <team>` (same team name as above).
   Removes stale members and their inboxes.
3. Read project plan (`docs/project-plan.md`)
4. Check current status (branches, PRs, worktrees)
5. Output concise project summary and status to user
6. Identify the next sprint(s) ready to execute
7. Be prepared to begin the next sprint upon user approval
