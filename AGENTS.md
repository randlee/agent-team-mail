# AGENTS Instructions for agent-team-mail

## MUST READ

Before participating in ATM team work, read:
- `docs/team-protocol.md`

The messaging protocol in that document is mandatory for all ATM communications.

## Quick Rule

Always follow this sequence for every ATM message:
1. Immediate acknowledgement
2. Do the work
3. Completion summary
4. Immediate completion acknowledgement by receiver

No silent processing.
