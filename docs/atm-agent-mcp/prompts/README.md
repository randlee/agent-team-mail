# Codex CLI System Prompts

These are system prompts extracted from the [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) source code for reference during `atm-agent-mcp` development.

## Source

Repository: https://github.com/openai/codex
Path: `codex-rs/codex-core/src/prompts/`

## Important

These prompts are model-specific and version-locked. When OpenAI upgrades foundation models, new prompts ship with the corresponding Codex CLI release. **Update these copies when upgrading the target Codex version** to ensure prompt compatibility with the active model.
